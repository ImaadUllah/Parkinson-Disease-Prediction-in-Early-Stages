The Parkinson disease contribute up to 45% of sudden deaths. So it is very important to detect or predict before it reaches to serious stages. If Parkinson predicted in its early stages, then it helps to save the lives. Statistical methods are generally used for classification of risks of Parkinson i.e. high risk or low risk. Sometime it becomes difficult to handle the complex interactions of highdimensional data.

## Objectives

> *Machine learning techniques* can be used to overcome these drawbacks which are cause due to the high dimensions of the data. So in this project I am using machine learning algorithms to predict the chances of getting cancer.


### Libraries used : 
```
  * pandas
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * plotly
  * cufflinks
```

## Algorithms Used

The Algorithms used are : 

	* RandomForestClassifier
  	* MLP in Deep Learning
